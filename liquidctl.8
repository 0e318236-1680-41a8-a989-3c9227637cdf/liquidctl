.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBliquidctl\fR is a utility for monitoring and controlling some hardware
monitoring devices not yet supported at the kernel level.
.PP
Because \fBliquidctl\fR directly accesses the hardware devices root privileges
are required in most cases.  This can be mitigate to some extent with udev
rules.
.PP
\fBliquidctl list\fR outputs all compatible devices found on the system.  In
case more than one device is found, the displayed device number can be used to
select it in later invocations.
.PP
Passing \fI--verbose\fR to \fBlist\fR enables the display of additional
identifiers and address which can also be used to select specific devices.
These are preferred for non-interactive invocations as they, unlike device
numbers, are more stable across reboots and software or hardware updates.
.PP
\fBliquidctl initialize\fR should be called for every device after a reboot,
since many of them require some initialization code before correctly responding
to other commands.
.PP
\fBliquidctl status\fR displays the status of a device or, if no selection
options have been passed, of all available devices.
.PP
\fBliquidctl set \fIchannel\fB speed\fR allows the user to set fan and pump
speeds.  These, depending on the device, can be set to fixed duty values,
variable temperatureâ€“duty curves, or both.
.PP
\fBliquidctl set \fIchannel\fB color\fR allows the user to configure and set
lighting modes.  Which modes and additional options are supported is device
dependent.
