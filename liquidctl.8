.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBliquidctl\fR is a utility for monitoring and controlling some hardware
monitoring devices not yet supported at the kernel level.  Because
\fBliquidctl\fR directly accesses the hardware devices root privileges are
generally required, though this can be avoided with appropriate udev rules.
.PP
\fBliquidctl list\fR outputs all compatible devices found on the system.  In
case more than one device is found, the displayed device number can be used to
select it in later invocations.  Passing \fI\-\-verbose\fR enables the display
of additional identifiers and addresses that can also be used to select
specific devices.  These are preferred for non-interactive invocations as they,
unlike device numbers, are more stable across reboots and software or hardware
updates.
.PP
\fBliquidctl initialize\fR should be called for every device after a reboot,
since many of them require some initialization code before correctly responding
to other commands.
.PP
\fBliquidctl status\fR displays the status of a device or, if no selection
options have been passed, of all available devices.
.PP
\fBliquidctl set \fIchannel\fB speed\fR allows the user to set fan and pump
speeds.  These, depending on the device, can be set to fixed duty values,
variable temperatureâ€“duty curves, or both.
.PP
\fBliquidctl set \fIchannel\fB color\fR allows the user to configure and set
lighting modes.  Each color is specified in hexadecimal RGB, without prefixes
(e.g. \fIff2608\fR).  Which modes and additional options are supported is
device dependent.
.

.
.SH FILES
.TP
.I /run/liquidctl/*
Temporary storage required by some drivers.
.\" on Linux systems where /run is not available, or on other platforms, the
.\" temporary storage will be placed elsewhere (see asetek.py and it's use of
.\" appdirs); package maintainers should update this man page when necessary
